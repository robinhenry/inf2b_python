# inf2b_python

This repository is a replication of my work for an Introductory Machine Learning coursework at The University of Edinburgh, which I [originally completed in MATLAB](https://github.com/robinhenry/inf2b_matlab). I wanted to learn Python and get familiar with Numpy, so here we are!

## Assignment
The goal of this assignment was to classify, as accurately as possible, handwritten characters taken from the EMNIST dataset (https://www.nist.gov/itl/iad/image-group/emnist-dataset). Each character image was represented as 28-by-28 pixels in gray scale, being stored as a row vector of 784 elements (28 Ã— 28 = 784). This coursework was completed using MATLAB 2015.

### Task 1
Using K-NN classification.

### Task 2
Using Naive Bayes classification with multivariate Bernoulli distributions.

### Task 3
Using Bayes classification with Gaussian distributions, where each class (character) is modelled with a multivariate Gaussian distribution.

### Task 3B
Same as done in 3A, with the addition of a K-means clustering algorithm. Each class was divided into different clusters to achieve a more accurate prediction.
